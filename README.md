# Building a Scalable, Secure & Highly Available 3-tier Web App in AWS using Terraform

This project focuses on designing and deploying a secure, highly available and scalable 3-tier web application using Terraform. The architecture leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to automate the provisioning of resources across AWS, ensuring consistency and efficiency. The 3-tier architecture is divided into three layers: the web-tier (front-end), application-tier (business logic), and database-tier (data management) tiers, each deployed within its respective subnet and security group to enhance security and modularity.
